        <h2> Ingrediants </h2>
        <uL>
            <li>1-2 tortillas. Any brand works, but you can decide if you want the tortilla folded in half, or 2 tortillas together.</li>
            <li>
                ~4 small pinches of (Mozzarella, Oaxaca, or Montery Jack cheese).
                <ul>
                    <li>Most cheeses are fine, but the taste of oaxaca cheese is more authentic.</li>
                    <li>If you don’t have pre-grated cheese, you can cut thin slices off of the block of cheese.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A thin coating of oil on the pan. It will be more traditional, but also more unhealthy. (Optional)</li>
            <li>Any ingredients you want. ie, veggies, chicken, mushrooms (cooked), or beans</li>
        </uL>

        <h2> Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a pan to medium with an (optional) thin coating of oil.</li>
            <li>
                Lay a single tortilla down on the pan and arrange cheese on the edges.
                <ul>
                    <li>Arrange on 1 edge if you are making a folded quesadilla. Do both edges if using 2 tortillas. 
                        The cheese will help make sure the ingredients don’t fall out when flipping.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Add the ingredients onto one half of the tortilla if using 1, or the entire surface if using 2.</li>
            <li>
                Fold empty half of the tortilla in the pan onto itself if you are only using one tortilla.
                <ul>
                    <li>If you are using 2 simply place the second on top of the first.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Periodically flip the tortilla until both sides are golden brown.
                <ul>
                    <li>This may be hard if using 2 tortillas, so try your best or transfer it to a plate, flip it with your hands, 
                        and transfer it back to the pan.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
